3Spam Detection using SVM
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect spam messages using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model leverages techniques such as TF-IDF Vectorization and SMOTE for handling class imbalance to improve prediction accuracy.

Introduction
Spam detection is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) to filter out unwanted messages. This project demonstrates how to build a spam classifier using SVM and various preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named spam.csv, which contains two main columns:

label: Indicates whether the message is "spam" or "ham" (not spam).
message: The actual text message.
Ensure that the dataset file is uploaded before running the code.
